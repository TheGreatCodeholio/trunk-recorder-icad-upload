CMake Warning (dev) in CMakeLists.txt:
  No project() command is present.  The top-level CMakeLists.txt file must
  contain a literal, direct call to the project() command.  Add a line of
  code such as

    project(ProjectName)

  near the top of the file, but after cmake_minimum_required().

  CMake is pretending there is a "project(Project)" command on the first
  line.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

CMake Warning (dev) in CMakeLists.txt:
  cmake_minimum_required() should be called prior to this top-level project()
  call.  Please see the cmake-commands(7) manual for usage documentation of
  both commands.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:1 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findeclipse-paho-mqtt-c.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "eclipse-paho-mqtt-c", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "eclipse-paho-mqtt-c" with any of the following names:

    eclipse-paho-mqtt-cConfig.cmake
    eclipse-paho-mqtt-c-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "eclipse-paho-mqtt-c" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  or set "eclipse-paho-mqtt-c_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "eclipse-paho-mqtt-c" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.


CMake Warning (dev) in CMakeLists.txt:
  No cmake_minimum_required command is present.  A line of code such as

    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.27)

  should be added at the top of the file.  The version specified may be lower
  if you wish to support older CMake versions for this project.  For more
  information run "cmake --help-policy CMP0000".
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
